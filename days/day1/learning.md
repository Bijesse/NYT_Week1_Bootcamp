##Learning on the Job

Objectives: 
Students will be able to name and implement 3 strategies they can use to help themselves without bugging their manager

(5 min) Opening:
Raise your hand if you’ve ever felt stuck before and gotten frustrated when coding. What was that like / how did it feel / what were you doing? (Have a few students share out, or tell the person next to them)

Now, think of a time when you’ve been really really focused on something, maybe homework, a personal project, and then someone interrupted you, right in the middle of it. How did that feel? Frustrating, right?

You’re going to feel both of those things at your jobs this summer (You’ll also feel a lot of other things like nervous, excited, proud, probably sleepy, hungry, itchy..), so in order to avoid that as much as possible, we thought we’d give you some strategies and resources so that when you feel stuck you can figure out what to do without bugging your manager too much. Of course, sometimes, you’ll have to ask your manager, and we’ll help you with that too.

(10 min) Introduction to New Material / Practice
We have 4 strategies for you to try before asking your manager for help. They are awesome. Sometimes you’ll get an answer right away. Sometimes you won’t. If you try one, don’t just wait. Keep digging! They include:
Ask yourself. This might sound obvious…. but sometimes if you pause and think for 5-10 minutes, you can figure out the answer. You can also look through your old code. You all are smart! Ask Google.  Google knows all! Protip: use this formula:
`<programming language> <verb> <specific keywords>`
e.g. “JavaScript remove key from object”
Practice: How would I google for how to click on buttons in jQuery?
Ask your internship buddy OR the internship google group (if you have one). High Five someone else on your team! They are smart and have a great brain that can help you! You can also ask everyone in this room by e-mailing scripted-interns-2015@googlegroups.com . I know I don’t need to say it, but all communication in this group must be appropriate and internship-related..or you will be banned. ScriptEd staff sees everything sent through this e-mail list.

Practice: When I say go, ask the members of your group (or yourself, if you’re alone)... see if anyone else knows how to add an item to the end of an array).

What if all these fail? Okay, sometimes these won’t work, and you’ll still be stuck. In that case, you’ll need to let your manager know you don’t know what you’re doing. Here’s some good guidelines for doing that:
Make sure it’s a good time. 
Is your manager in a meeting? On the phone? Not a good time. 
Alone, working? Might be a good time!
Ask! How might you ask your manager if now is a good time? (have students make suggestions -- a good one would be, “Hi, Manager. I have a question. Is now a good time for me to ask?”)
If they say no: Ask when a good time might be. How might you say that?(have students suggest answers “Okay, no problem. When should I come back?”)
If they say yes: Woohoo! You can tell them that you need help, and explain specifically what you need help with. Don’t just say, “I’m stuck.” For example, if I’m working on a for loop and my browser keeps crashing and I can’t figure it out.. how might I ask for help? (Have students practice with eachother, then share out)

Independent Practice
(15 mins) Give students some [coding challenges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pvui8o2tMMP7P0VTenPgp3dJxTR0qIBcjrL2B8oLb6s/edit?usp=sharing) . We can e-mail these out to the google group. They can use these 3 strategies to figure out the answers. Encourage them to play with the google group.

(10 mins) Okay, now we’re going to do a role play. You will have to find a partner near you. You will take turns, one of you will be the manager, and one of you will be the intern. You each have a handout with some questions that you have to ask the manager. Managers, you can decide -- is now a good time? Is now not a good time? Interns, practice asking the questions! This might feel weird, but I promise, practicing this stuff will help for later when you actually have to do it.

Closing
Okay! How did that feel? (Have some students share out). You’ve learned some strategies & 	resources that you can use when you inevitably get stuck during your internships. Who can tell me what they are? (Have a student share).
