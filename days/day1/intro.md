Congratulations! You are the 2016 NYT Jr. Internship Class!  
This week will cover a mixture of technical lessons and professionalism lessons to prepare you for the projects you will work on this summer.


Before we get started we are going to do our first of several Scrum meetings this week. 

Scrum meeting -- each attendee shares about themselves, what they want to get out of the internship.


[Here](https://github.com/Bijesse/NYT_Week1_Bootcamp) is the schedule for the week. Please review it. What materials on this list do you feel comfortable with and what materials do you feel you need a refresher/introduction?
